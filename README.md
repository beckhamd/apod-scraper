# Astronomy Picture of the Day Scraper

This is a web scraper for NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/) website that runs on [morph.io](https://morph.io/beckhamd/apod-scraper). The images are stored in a database that can then be queried using the morph.io API.

As noted in [openjck/apod-scraper](https://github.com/openjck/apod-scraper), there is now an official NASA API that can be used for this same purpose. However, the morph.io API can still be useful as a fallback option. This is demonstrated in my [NASA Imagery Fetcher](https://github.com/daniel-beckham/nasa-imagery-fetcher) project.
